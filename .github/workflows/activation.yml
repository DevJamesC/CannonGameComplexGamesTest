          #Run this in github actions... it will output a .alf file as the unity license (so we can run the project in the build server)
          #1: download the .alf file and unzip it.
          #2: upload the .afl file to https://license.unity3d.com/manual to register the license and get a .ulf unity license file.
          #3: Download the .ulf, open it, copy the value, and set it as a secret in github called UNITY_LICENSE
          #4: Create a UNITY_EMAIL and UNITY_PASSWORD Secret (look in the guide for this... it's skipped over in the video)
          #5: In the settings, make sure that Settings->Actions->General->Read And Write Permissions are toggled
